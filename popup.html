    <h1>Exploring the AI Engineering Movement</h1> <p>A few logistical things: <ol> <li>I'm carrying a magic Trackpad because everyone has clickers, so today we're going to experiment with multi-dimensional slides.</li> <li>I'm using AI and fancy new technology, and we're also going two-dimensional with our slides.</li> </ol> </p> <h2>Embracing Higher Ambitions in the AI Era</h2> <p>Welcome to the AI Engineer conference, where we believe in the value of exploring higher orders of magnitude to raise ambitions. I encourage all of you to do the same and to bring this mindset back home with you. Let's delve into the world of AI-generated art and congratulate ourselves for being in the right place at the right time. We are at the forefront of a major technological revolution, and it's crucial to expand our intelligences and embrace the timing of this momentous era. Our thought process is heavily influenced by the installation and deployment periods of tech cycles, and we're currently experiencing a similar revolution today.</p> <p>The Timing of the AI Revolution. The AI Revolution started approximately 10 years ago, and we've witnessed significant advancements in computational capabilities, particularly in training models. These developments have paved the way for monumental progress in AI, and we must take scaling seriously as we anticipate a substantial increase in investment in language models and AI technologies. This revolution signifies a significant opportunity for us to live through and lead mega-trends that surpass any single individual's impact.</p> <h2>The Demand for AI Engineers</h2> <p>The demand for AI Engineers is on the rise, and it's essential to recognize the emerging gaps and opportunities in this dynamic field. With a vast supply of registered developers, the need for AI Engineers is evident and presents a compelling market. To address this demand, we must differentiate between the roles of AI-enhanced engineers, product engineers, and AI engineering agents. These distinctions lay the foundation for career progression and specialization within the field of AI engineering.</p> <h2>The Role of AI Engineers</h2> <p>Our vision for the future of AI engineering spans across three categories: AI-enhanced engineers, product engineers, and AI engineering agents. It's crucial to understand the nuances between roles such as being enhanced by AI versus building AI products and the implications for the evolving landscape of engineering. As we navigate this journey, it's essential to involve ourselves in the AI movement and explore its potential to enhance productivity and revolutionize industries.</p> <h2>Empowering the AI Engineering Community</h2> <p>This conference serves as a platform to connect with leading figures in the AI engineering movement and collaborate on a collective mission to propel the industry forward. We are in the midst of an extraordinary opportunity to learn, share insights, and foster networks of AI engineers. I encourage everyone to actively engage with the speakers, sponsors, and fellow participants to maximize the value of this experience.</p> <h2>The Impact of a 10x Engineer</h2> <p>At the core of the AI engineering journey lies the concept of a 10x engineer, characterized by their ability to empower and educate others. This non-technical yet immensely valuable trait can significantly contribute to the growth and success of the AI engineering community. By embracing and embodying the principles of knowledge sharing and network building, we can collectively enhance the AI engineering landscape and shape the future of this burgeoning industry.</p> <h2>Embracing the AI Engineer Journey</h2> <p>I hope that this conference provides you with a deep understanding of the pivotal role you can play in the AI engineering movement. Let's embark on this journey together and seize the tremendous opportunities awaiting us in this transformative industry. Thank you for being part of this experience, and I look forward to witnessing the incredible strides we will collectively make in the AI engineering space.</p>
